# Target of the project

 - Hi Swaraj,
Your resume seems promising to us, to judge your level and expertise in the flutter domain, we have curated a small task for you before moving further.
We are looking for a full-stack flutter developer, hence the task is curated accordingly, there is no bar on the time limit but just reply "I am interested" to book your seat, and it's completely based on a first come first serve basis.
Here is your task:
Use the attached JSON file as your mock data as an API response, 

## Bugs

- [x] Clear TextEditingController

## Pending 

- [ ] Optimization

## Steps

- [x] parse this user data and display it in a list view, alongside his name there will be a button named sign-in!
- [x] UI done.
- [x] Login Part pending.
- [ ] Once the user taps on his name for the first time, he’ll be prompted a dialog where he needs to fill in his age and gender
- [ ] once they have done so, it’ll take the user to the new screen where he’ll be displayed his name, age, gender!
- [ ] Now, once this is done every individual user sign-in is retained in local storage, using the DB of your preference like getting storage, hive… so now the sign-in button alongside the name changes to sign-out.
- [ ] The next time the user clicks over his name he is not shown the dialog, simply taken to the next screen, where his details name, age, and gender are shown.
- [ ] On clicking sign-out, we remove the user sign-in state from the local DB, so the button toggles to sign in once again!

## Context
You have all creative freedom for the UI, clean code architecture and proper state management will be given priority.
Looking forward to having some amazing codebase from your side.
